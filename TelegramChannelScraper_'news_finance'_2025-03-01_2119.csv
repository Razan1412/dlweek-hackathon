Adding 180 GW of clean energy is a massive total, but still falls short of what is needed to clean up the electricity sector. It equates to roughly 60 percent of what is needed each year in order to meet long-term climate goals, the IEA said.

India’s economy has nearly sextupled in size in less than 20 years.
At the turn of the millennium the country’s gross domestic product was approximately $459 billion, according to the World Bank. Last year, it generated the equivalent of $2.726 trillion. That’s an expansion of just short of six times in less than two decades."

The UN’s climate-change watchdog says our choice of diet is directly linked to land use and to its abuse, a key driver of the problem. Scientists claim a radical shift in how land is treated is crucial to saving the planet.
The report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that any efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and halt global warming may soon be futile without changes in global land use, agriculture and human diets.
It emphasizes that, while the earth’s population is growing, demand for food is growing accordingly. This tendency will only increase in the near future, but the planet’s resources are limited, with roughly 70% of land already being used for food production, textiles and fuel."

Citigroup faced the darkest moment in its two-century history. It was rapidly losing money, its stock price was in free fall and it was cutting tens of thousands of jobs. The troubled bank turned to Dick Parsons to lead it out.

The drone strike on key Saudi oil facilities could stoke already-flaring tensions in the Middle East, driving crude prices higher amid growing fears of supply shortages, market and industry experts believe.

The consequences of the strikes led to uncertainty in the oil market as it’s unclear when the oil giant can restore operations to normal.
Analysts warn that it will take longer than had initially been thought to reopen the refineries, which were shut down after the strikes triggered massive fires there. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, believes several months will pass before the entire plants are back to normal, but production may actually be resumed earlier than that."

With the US Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates for the second time on Wednesday, Euro Pacific Capital CEO Peter Schiff has discussed with RT’s Boom Bust what the move will bring to US economy.
“The Federal Reserve has been artificially suppressing interest rates particularly since the 2008 financial crisis. By keeping interest rates artificially low, they’ve created a bubble much bigger than they popped in 2008,” the analyst said.
Earlier this week, the Fed made an emergency injection into the banking system to prevent interest rates from rising, which amounted to between $50 billion and $70 billion, according to various estimates. According to Schiff, this signals that the situation is spiraling out of control."

China has become one of the world's biggest buyers of gold, adding more than 100 tons of bullion to its coffers this year amid the trade war with the United States.
According to Alasdair Macleod of Goldmoney, China already pretty much controls the world’s physical gold market. He suggests that much of those holdings are not declared as monetary reserves.

There’s an “uncomfortably high” chance that a recession could hit the global economy in the near future, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. Policymakers may not be able to reverse that course, he said.
“I think risks are awfully high that if something doesn’t stick to script then we do have a recession,” Zandi told CNBC. “I’ll say this also: Even if we don’t have a recession over the next 12-18 months, I think it’s pretty clear that we’re going to have a much weaker economy.”
The economist said there are many factors which could help avoid a slowdown in economic activity; these include US President Donald Trump not escalating the trade war with China, the UK finding a resolution to Brexit, and central banks continuing their monetary stimulus."

Russia’s financial messaging system SPFS will be linked with the Chinese cross-border interbank payment system CIPS. While India does not have a domestic financial messaging system yet, it plans to combine the Central Bank of Russia’s platform with a domestic service that is in development.
The new system is expected to work as a “gateway” model when messages on payments are transcoded in accordance with a certain financial system."

The EU argues that Norway, which is not part of the European Union, is in violation of the Svalbard Treaty because it discriminates between Norwegian and foreign fishing vessels. The 1920 international agreement guarantees Norway's sovereignty over Svalbard, while providing opportunities for signatory countries to conduct business and fishing there.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) has ruled that some $7 billion in Indian export subsidies violate trade rules and should be halted, upholding an American complaint filed last year and prompting US officials to declare victory.
In its decision the WTO panel “recommended that India withdraw the prohibited subsidies” and tax breaks for certain favored exporters within 90, 120 and 180 days, depending on the type of subsidy. While the panel rejected aspects of the American complaint, the Office of the US Trade Representative nonetheless called it a win, celebrating the move as a “resounding victory for the United States” which will help create a “level playing field” in global trade.

Higher oil prices tend to drive consumer prices higher because they increase the cost of making and transporting goods.
On the other hand, holding gold is a favorite way of protecting against inflation.
Geopolitical crises or supply disruptions such as the September Saudi Aramco drone attacks also support higher oil prices. High oil prices tend to coincide with periods of high inflation and lower economic growth, while gold is a popular hedge against inflation, thus the positive correlation."

Investors have recently put fears about the pace of global growth aside, opting for optimism on a ""phase one"" US-China trade deal. But muted economic data expected out of Europe this week could change the mood.
Germany may post data Thursday indicating that it's in recession. Economists surveyed by Reuters believe the world's fourth largest economy shrank 0.1% between July and September — marking two straight quarters of negative growth.
It's possible that Germany — which has been hit by the trade war, as well as falling global demand for autos — just dodged a bullet. Exports unexpectedly rebounded in September, rising 1.5% compared to the previous month. August data was also revised upward."

In July, the city council in Berkeley, California, passed an ordinance requiring all new homes to be all-electric with no gas hook-ups beginning in January 2020. Berkeley’s primary motivation for the gas hook-up ban was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the use of clean energy.

The warning was voiced by Dr. Marcos Lopez de Prado, professor at Cornell University’s School of Engineering, as he testified before the US House Committee on Financial Services Committee on Friday at a hearing to determine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on сapital markets.
The professor said that, while tech firms started distributing data and crowdsource the jobs of data analysts through special tournaments, any investment challenge could be solved by an army of data scientists without financial background. Thus “the highest paying jobs in finance” could be put at risk, he noted, adding that asset managers could crowdsource their entire research function, while insurance companies could do the same with their actuarial models."

South Africa’s beleaguered flagship carrier, South African Airways (SAA) has received a 4 billion rand ($272 million) lifeline from the government and banks.
It’s the latest in a series of government bailouts the struggling company has received in recent years.
“Our desire is that the restructured airline will mark the beginning of a new era in South African aviation,” the country’s public enterprises minister, Pravin Gordhan, said on Friday while announcing the plan. “It is also important that the reliance on government finances be reduced as soon as possible to minimize disruption to SAA services, customers, staff and other stakeholders.”"

Mexican state oil company Pemex has announced the biggest oil discovery in the country since 1987. The deposit in the southeast of the country may have reserves of 500 million barrels of crude.
The giant Quesqui site in the Gulf Coast state of Tabasco was discovered several months ago, with the first well, which is now producing 4,500 barrels per day, drilled in June. However, after studying the potential of the field, the company announced that the deposit is one of the most important discoveries in 30 years.

Apple's new Mac Pro is about to go on sale. The top-of-the-line Mac, anticipated by power users for its jaw-dropping specs, and by Apple design fans for its cheese-grater-like appearance, will be available for preorders beginning Tuesday.
It's the computer's first update in six years and it looks drastically different than its predecessor. Apple ditched the previous ""trash can"" cylinder design for a more traditional tower shape that has several holes for cooling and a handle on top. The computer is loaded with a 28-core Intel (INTC) and 1.5 TB of system memory.
It comes at a cost: $6,000 for the computer alone. Cusotmers can also have to buy the 32-inch 6K retina LCD display, called the Pro Display XDR, for an additional $4,999. There's also a $999 monitor stand, but the computer can be used without it if you lean the monitor against the computer or purchase a mount adapter."

The timing of the U.S drone attacks in the Middle East was interesting… We’ve yet to hear of any Republicans looking to jump from the Unity Ship… This could change, however, with the talk of additional impeachment articles hitting the news wires.

🇺🇸🇨🇳Trade Wars: It’s been a long time coming. The U.S and China are scheduled to sign the phase 1 agreement on Wednesday. While the signing is risk positive, the markets will want to know what’s next. Impeachment, rising tensions in the Middle East and the 2020 Presidential Election campaign may hit pause on further progress on this side of Election Day. That may not be too appealing for the global financial markets.

There is also the risk of the U.S President backing away from signing…

🇬🇧UK Politics: The UK Parliament voted on the Withdrawal Bill last week. In the week ahead, the focus will likely shift to the EU. Member states have until 1st February to submit their requirements to begin negotiations. With 11-months remaining until the end of the Transition Period, expect sensitivity towards the prospects of a trade agreement to continue.

✊Iran and the Middle East: It was a big week for the markets last week. Iran’s missile attacks in retaliation to the killing of Soleimani raised a number of red flags. While the retaliation eased pressure on Iran’s supreme leader to do more, it was far from a significant response. It remains to be seen whether there is more to come. The uncertainty over what’s next will leave the markets sensitive to any chatter from Tehran and Washington. Fresh sanctions will give Tehran more food for thought…"

It’s a quiet day ahead on the economic calendar. There are no material stats due out of the Eurozone to provide the EUR with direction.

We will expect November trade figures, also due out, to have less influence on the day.

Last week, BoE Governor Carney sent the Pound on a slide. Positive numbers today would ease expectations of a near-term move by the BoE.

It’s a relatively quiet day on the economic calendar. While there are no material stats scheduled for release, the BoC will release its Business Outlook Survey later this afternoon.

With economic indicators out of Canada having been mixed of late, the Survey will garner plenty of attention.

The Bank of Canada will also release its consumer expectations survey for the first time. How the BoC sees consumer and business sentiment will give some idea on whether the BoC will continue to stand pat on policy.

In October, the Business Outlook Survey had reflected some improvement in business sentiment. With the U.S and China on the cusp of signing a phase 1 agreement and the USMCA wrapped up, there should be some further improvement…

A bounce back in employment in December, leading to a fall in the unemployment rate should also support a more positive outlook.

The virus that has spread from China around the world appears to be readily transmitted between humans, but infectious disease experts are uncertain how lethal it will be.

The virus has killed more than 360 people in China, a toll that exceeds the one during an outbreak of SARS in the country in the early 2000s. SARS had a mortality rate of 9.6 percent, but only about 2 percent of those reported to have been infected with the new coronavirus have died. Here are the latest updates."

President Trump said in an Oval Office address on Wednesday that most visitors from Continental Europe would be blocked for 30 days, part of a series of measures intended to address the coronavirus outbreak.

The limits take effect on Friday and will exempt American citizens and permanent legal residents and their families. 

His remarks came hours after the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic, a term that it had avoided using for fear that countries would give up on containment efforts. 

In other developments:

■ The outbreak ended one of the longest bull markets in history on Wednesday, and global stocks fell sharply again today.

■ House Democrats plan a vote today on an emergency aid package as lawmakers discuss a broader economic stimulus measure with the White House.

■ More U.S. colleges and universities ordered students to leave campus housing as they shift to remote instruction.

■ The N.B.A. suspended its season after a player tested positive for the virus. Separately, the N.C.A.A. announced that its men’s and women’s Division I basketball tournaments would be played without spectators.

■ Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy ordered almost all businesses nationwide to close. The country has more than half of the confirmed coronavirus cases in Europe.

■ The actor Tom Hanks said that he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had tested positive for the virus. They’re in Australia, where he was set to begin production on a film.

Price Action this week, has pulled back into the lows of the consolidated range. 

Price Action moved lower overnight on the Moderna news initially which was seen as Bullish for the markets, however momentum soon dissipated as sentiment between the US/China intensified further. 

From a technical perspective, All attention is focused on  a pullback into the 1.7975 area to see if Price can be sustained at or above this area. 

Forming the shorter term inverted head and shoulders structure. If this structure is broken then Price Action will look to return to the Asian session lows made overnight.

Price Action, however, briefly broke into the 200 & 800 EMA's on both the 1hr & 4hr timeframes before catching the bid overnight and return to the 1.2600 level. 

So far this morning, Price Action since the beginning of the London session has been quite muted as price continues to hold just below the 1.2600 area.

Looking at this pair in more depth, the 1hr we have the initial upside breakout also identified with a pullback to retest the current zone. It's extremely important now that we get the breakout to be sustained for more upside today. Of course, any closure back below the current area invalidates the potential upside bias. - whilst letting the candle closure and Price Action confirm the view.

Price Action this morning on the daily tf again holding below the near term highlighted level illustrated. On the daily we are also noting the clear technical rejection of the 61.8 fib level on both last Tuesday & Wednesday to start the month of September. 

From here, watching for the closure and rejection to set forth the bearish continuation to the downside. Any bullish closure above the 0.8800 level and the 800ema on the Daily TF invalidates the bearish outlook.

The price is in a bullish channel which has broken previous recent high of $1.99 per share by $0.04. After this move to $2.03 the price has seen some selling pressure but the price found support at the up trend line of the current bullish channel.

The daily time frame can give us a pretty good idea of the overall short term trend which is clearly pointed to the upside with a lot of room to fall lower without impacting the trend. The price can fall as low as $1.35 per share and still remain in overall uptrend, as that’s the main 200 EMA support.

You can also notice, that EMA’s are giving us considerable golden cross, which is a pretty bullish indication of long lasting uptrend that happens when 50 Moving average crosses 200 Moving average.

One think that we missed yesterday, was the Falling wedge pattern which has started the rally from $1.45 to $1.80, resulting on over 20% increase in 4 days. Yesterday we were also talking about the failed bull flag, but when we zoomed into the chart, we can see that actually the price was in bullish flag yesterday and has managed to actually break out from this flag as you can see in the chart.

RSI is still above 60 which is a good sign and the fact that it has found support on the previous resistance, same as the price did is just yet another good sign for a healthy growth.

Currently the ZKIN is riding on a uptrend line while the key resistance of $1.80 remains unchanged. A break of $1.80 with a full candle would mean a likely bullish continuation towards $1.90.

We have also spotted another big and interesting pattern that we would like to showcase on the next 2h analysis.

As long as the price doesn’t break below 50 EMA, which is currently located at $8.00, the price of ZKIN should see a breakout all the way possibly to $10!

However there is still psychological resistance resistance at $9.00, a break of this level is likely to bring extended gains to bespoken two digits price!

Trend line support is located at 50 EMA, $8.00. A break below this level is expected to correct the price to $7.00 as the price is currently very volatile.

Trend of higher highs is located at $8.60

MACD fails to give a proper signal by changing from buying to a selling way and the other way around often. 

RSI failed to break above 60 and is currently seeking support. There is a slight bearish divergence on RSI as it’s trending lower, trend of lower highs while the price is printing higher highs. This divergence is pointing to a correction."

It’s an astonishing figure when weighed against broker giants Fidelity and Schwab, competitors that have existed far longer than the eight-year-old broker-dealer. Robinhood also reserved 35% of its shares for its 18M users, if they wanted them. But it looks like they didn’t. 😅

Robinhood generates revenue through a controversial practice called Payment for Order Flow (PFOF). PFOF helped power commission-free trading, but the practice could suffer regulatory blows in the near future as reviews of the broker-dealer industry continue.

$HOOD fell 8.3% today to close at $34.82. That price values the company at around $29B."

It might have been a big week for Big Tech stocks reporting earnings, but unfortunately, the results were not nearly as exciting as we’d hoped for. 😩

Five of America’s largest tech companies reported strong earnings this week, then they started tumbling. The reason? Slowing revenue growth forecasts.

The selloff affected Amazon the most, which beat on EPS but fell short on revenue. Analysts expected $115.2B, but ended up with $113B. $AMZN dove 9.4% this week.

Google parent Alphabet brought the strongest performance. The company was expected to report $56.2B in revenue and $19.32/share in EPS. They knocked it out of the park with $61.8B in revenue and $27.26/share. Investors were initially satiated with the results, but the stock pulled back after earnings.

Strong Q2 earnings also came out of Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft. However, none of them avoided the post-earnings blues. 🥶🥶🥶

Investors aren’t sure what a post-pandemic world looks like for Big Tech, but a lot is riding on its success.

Robinhood didn’t exactly make a star-studded market debut… but $HOOD could be boasting one of the sickest post-“bad IPO” comebacks we’ve ever seen. 🚀

Robinhood fell from $38 to close at $34.82 on the day of its IPO. Since then, $HOOD has only seen upside. The stock is up 102.1% since last Thursday, its first day listed. Here’s the intraday chart:

Demand for the IPO was mixed at best. This happened because many retail investors felt they were “wronged” by Robinhood’s decision to freeze some stocks’ trading amidst January’s market volatility. Tons of potential $HOOD investors stayed away, concerned about volatility in the stock itself. They got what they were looking for and now they want in. 

Some of that volatility can be attributed to two things: options trading (which started today) and reportedly-high levels of short volume. According to Fintel, $HOOD stock has demonstrated a short volume ratio of greater than 50% every day since its IPO. 😅 The short volume ratio is calculated as the difference between FINRA short volume and FINRA total volume.

The Nasdaq’s proposal to mandate diversity requirements for Nasdaq-listed companies has been… (drumroll) approved. 🥁 ✅

The proposal will require listed companies to appoint at least one woman and at least one racial or LGBTQ+ minority to a director role. The Nasdaq will also require publicly-listed companies to report diversity statistics.

Board diversity requirements for businesses are controversial, but prevalent in other countries. For example: Norway, Spain, France, and Iceland mandate all company boards to include 40% women. However, research on director diversity is mixed. Some reports show board diversity improves company performance; others show no significant relationship between market performance and diversity.

Right now, over 75% of Nasdaq-listed companies don’t meet the minimum proposed requirements. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler shared:

“These rules will allow investors to gain a better understanding of Nasdaq-listed companies’ approach to board diversity, while ensuring that those companies have the flexibility to make decisions that best serve their shareholders.”

Some groups have criticized the proposal, claiming it could hinder financial performance. Some have suggested that it violates civil rights laws. Regardless, some large companies like Goldman Sachs and Microsoft have voiced their support. 🤷

This will likely be a topic of drama for a while on Wall Street and Capitol Hill."

The iGaming and sports betting industry are charging higher after two high-profile acquisitions. 💰 💰

Shares of the Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF ($BETZ) have increased 7% in the last week, ballooned by optimism surrounding $PENN and $DKNG‘s recent M&A deals. 🎈

On Thursday, Penn National Gaming made a bid to acquire sports betting platform theScore in a $2B deal. Penn, which owns a majority stake in Barstool Sports and its Barstool betting app, will pick up 4 million new daily active users. Many of theScore’s customers are in regions where Barstool Sportsbook is not currently offered, such as Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, New Jersey, and Canada.

This morning, DraftKings announced it would acquire Golden Nugget Online for $1.5B. The company offers iGaming in the United States, mostly through online casinos. With the deal, DraftKings will bring 5 million casino bettors into its orbit. 🚀 Investors weren’t initially sold on the acquisition’s value-add, but $GNOG CEO Tilman Feritta insists that iGaming customers are “worth seven times the value of a sports betting customer.”

Both deals support the prospects for more consolidation and M&A in the betting and iGaming industry. The online betting M&A narrative is mirrored in other industries — companies sitting on large pots of money have been investing to diversify their businesses, capture new audiences, and expand their horizons. ☀️

$PENN‘s acquisition was well-received, boosting the stock +4.4%. $DKNG‘s acquisition was generally well-received, pushing the stock up 1.59% in the day. Shares of both future acquisitions — $SRC.CA & $GNOG — saw double-digit gains. 💪"

What makes a broker in the crazy world of crypto?? That’s difficult to answer. At least, right now it is. The controversial infrastructure bill, which proposed broadening the definition of a broker, has reached a compromise. 

Today, ongoing drama over the bill took another twist when US Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) announced their compromise on cryptocurrency tax reporting provisions. The current provision broadens the definition of the term “broker” and treats software developers, node operators, and validators as brokers.

The Senators’ exact compromise still isn’t public knowledge, but Toomey said it would specify tax reporting obligations within the crypto industry. 

“We’re not proposing anything sweeping or anything radical – [the compromise] makes clear that a broker means only those persons that conduct transactions where consumers buy, sell and trade digital assets,” Toomey said.

Critics also say the compromise’s the language is vague. The definition of “broker” broadens to include any party involved in part of the cryptocurrency exchange process.

The problem? The compromise came after the Senate conducted voting late on Sunday. A final vote on the measure is expected early morning tomorrow. Since it’s a last-minute compromise, though, it’s unclear whether they’ll get a chance to put it to a vote on Tuesday. 🤷

Surprisingly, the compromise gained support from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, although the drama is unlikely to end soon. Fingers crossed for Tuesday morning. 🤞"

Last month, the Department of Justice launched a probe into the Tether stablecoin. The stablecoin, which has been around since 2014, has become one of the most valuable and pervasive digital assets. As of today, Tether is the 4th-largest crypto by market cap and boasts some $62.6 billion in circulation — that figure has prompted concern among regulators, because Tether isn’t backed dollar-for-dollar by Bitfinex. 🤔

Unfortunately, regulators are getting a new bone to pick thanks to USD Coin, which is issued by a consortium of companies called Centre. Coinbase and Centre assured the public that, unlike Tether, USDC was backed dollar-for-dollar in “a bank account.” But USDC wasn’t. 😬

The consortium’s first disclosure of assets last month revealed that USDC assets were held in “commercial paper, corporate bonds, and other assets that could experience losses.” That might not seem like a big deal, but the issuers of USD Coin lied about the way they back their stablecoin, which is a slap in the face to many investors. Those assets are not like the liquid cash you have in a bank account.

That’d be a problem if billions in USDC were ever redeemed, as it would be hard to liquidate cash alternatives fast enough. But ultimately, a lie is a lie. And unfortunately, misleading investors is likely to catch regulatory attention. These are things to consider next time you swap your coins for USDC. 🚨"

If you thought Tesla’s YTD performance was a problem, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet. 😅 The American automaker is being investigated by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

The investigation stems from 11 crashes involving Tesla’s driver-assist program, Autopilot. In each case, Autopilot crashed into stationary first responder vehicles. The first case was reported was in January 2018.

Tesla advertises Autopilot, released in October 2015, as safer than regular driving. Tesla’s official Vehicle Safety Report in Q1 2021 indicated that the company registered “one accident for every 4.19 million miles driven in which drivers had Autopilot engaged.” In contrast, Tesla claims that the NHTSA estimates an automobile crash to take place roughly “every 484,000 miles.”

Although Autopilot is described as “safer” than driving in general, the NHTSA might be investigating these pattern incidents out of an abundance of caution. The investigation will cover all 765,000+ Teslas in service today. However, EV and Tesla maxis are frustrated that the NHTSA’s investigation doesn’t include other similar assisted driving applications.

The market’s in the red. But what if we told you that this is actually a Freaky Friday moment that happens every month? 🤔

That’s the summary of a Bloomberg article published this morning. The article noted that the S&P 500’s worst dips have happened in the middle of the month. 

The article observes that the dip coincides with monthly options expiration, which happens near the middle of the month. Afterwards, though, the index soldiers on to new highs. Given the timing of this week’s dip, that trend seems to hold up. 

Despite these “blips,” the S&P 500 has not experienced a major correction since election season. The worst we’ve seen YTD is a drop just shy of -5% — for comparison, the dip around the 2020 election was -7%.

With each passing month, the probability of a more aggressive correction rises. According to one Morgan Stanley wealth manager, some valuations (namely in tech) are reaching levels comparable to past bubbles. 🙊"

While the Teslas and Microstrategies of the world buy Bitcoin, one emergent tech player is buying gold bars. We’re talking about Palantir, the big data analytics company run by Alex Karp and Peter Thiel.

One of those two names might sound familiar, but the real question is: are the Palantir guys a couple of boomers? I mean, who buys $50 million in gold bars?! 😅

The decision to pivot away from cash (and towards alternative assets) has become a popular move for companies and their balance sheets. In fact, many companies now allow customers to pay for products or services in cryptocurrencies or physical assets like gold — Palantir already accepts payments in Bitcoin and gold. 

Why the pivot from cash? Companies are worrying about global currencies, inflation, and related issues. Palantir could be afraid of another COVID-esque “black swan event,” but the company’s move might also have something to do with its $2.3 billion in cash holdings. 

It’s hard to know if adding alternatives to the balance sheet is anything more than Doomsday Prep. With that being said, the dollar is an unstoppable force and inflation is an immovable object. Inflation is rising, but so is the dollar.

Robinhood brought beefy revenues in its first earnings report since IPOing last month. 🏹  💪

The neo-broker, famous for revolutionizing no-commission trading and raking in millions of first-time investors during the pandemic, posted revenues of $565 million for the quarter. That’s up 131% from this time last year, beating analysts’ estimates.

The company observed most of its revenue from crypto trading, which amounted to $233 million (41.6%) of its revenue. This time last year, crypto revenues represented just $5 million. The remainder was made up of payment for order flow (PFOF) revenue on options trading ($165 million, 29% of revenue) and equities trading ($52 million, 9.2% of revenue).

Revenues from equities trading (purely buying or selling shares in a company) fell YoY, indicating a slowdown in trading volume. In fairness, Q2 2020 was a crazy time for retail traders. That slowdown came even as the number of active users more than doubled. BTW: the money all those new investors put to work has more than tripled YoY, too.

That slowdown is unlikely to stir investors given the strong revenue performance, but the company’s loss caused some capitulation. This quarter, Robinhood posted a loss of $502 million, or $2.16 per share. This time last year, that figure was a profit. 😬

Lyft and Uber took a big hit this weekend after a state judge ruled against a ballot proposition which would have allowed the companies to continue classifying drivers as independent contractors.

A state bill passed in 2019 would have required the companies to treat their workers as employees. That would have entitled drivers to benefits such as workers comp, unemployment, paid sick and family leave, and health insurance.

Because the companies didn’t want to put up with that, they dumped millions into lobbying for Proposition 22. The proposition would have overturned the passed bill, allowing the companies to consider their drivers as independent contractors.

Lyft, Uber, and DoorDash spent over $200 million on the Yes on 22 campaign. And that money worked in convincing the overwhelming majority of Californians to vote yes on the prop. Unfortunately, that money went up in flames after a judge found it was “unenforceable and unconstitutional.” 😲

This court battle will likely rage on in the months ahead. However, in the meantime, the companies will likely have to encumber Californians with higher prices on their rides and deliveries. And this adverse ruling for the companies almost certainly means moves for their stock prices… and not the good kind. 📉"

The Taliban took over Afghanistan with astonishing speed, but it appears unlikely that the militants will get quick access to most of the Afghan central bank’s roughly $10 billion in assets.

U.S. authorities are investigating Deutsche Bank — again. Apparently, DWS Group (Deutsche’s $1 trillion asset management arm) overstated the sustainable investing criteria used in its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy. 

Deutsche supposedly misled investors on the holdings in its ESG investing strategy, attempting to portray its investments in a (deceptively) positive light. In March 2021, DWS reported over $900 billion in assets invested with ESG strategy; secondary reports show only a fraction of the $900 billion actually followed sustainable investing criteria. 

DWS claims ESG is at the “heart of everything it does,” but the firm’s former sustainability chief begged to differ. Desiree Fixler, former DWS sustainability chief, claimed the asset manager struggled with its ESG strategy and misrepresented its ESG capabilities. Fixler was fired on Mar. 11. 🤔

Investors have seen worse days, but they’ve also seen better ones. Stocks moved lower today amidst concerns over the Fed Symposium and the political situation in Afghanistan. 

Investors have anxiously anticipated the Jackson Hole Fed Symposium for several weeks. Throughout the pandemic, the Fed printed trillions of dollars to help shore up businesses, the economy, and markets. The symposium will show investors what they can expect from America’s central bank in the months ahead.

However, investors did not anticipate the severity of the political situation in Afghanistan. Blasts in Kabul today killed a dozen U.S. troops and at least 60 Afghan civilians, sending a political shockwave through the markets.

Despite today’s attacks, President Joe Biden reiterated his commitment to a steadfast evacuation of the country. The President indicated that the U.S. would “respond with force and precision” to threats from ISIS-K. You can follow a liveblog of the situation here.

Speaking of Apple — is the Apple app store a monopoly? 🤔 A number of lawsuits against Big Tech players argue that it is. 

Google and Apple are both in bitter wars with their app store developers. Famously, Fortnite creator Epic Games sued Apple and Google over their app store practices. It’s one of hundreds of lawsuits, many brought by state governments and app developers from the “Coalition for App Fairness.“ The coalition includes notable members like Match Group (Tinder), Epic, and Spotify.

Today, South Korea spiced up this ongoing beef. 🌶️ The country is expected to pass a law banning Apple and Google’s monopoly on app store payment requirements. In other words, Apple and Google won’t be able to hold developers in contempt for circumventing their commissions.

In most of the world, Apple and Google take a 30% commission on app purchases, in-app purchases, subscriptions, and other payment options. But once the bill passes in South Korea, app developers can use any payment provider they want. 

South Korea’s move could mean bad news for Apple and Google, especially if it inspires copycat legislation in other countries. The app store generates hefty cashflow for both companies.

Bitcoin managed to get above the resistance at $48,000 and continues to move towards the psychologically important $50,000 level. Meanwhile, Ethereum climbed above the resistance at $3,600 and is trying to gain additional upside momentum.

Smaller cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin or XRP failed to develop material momentum, and it looks that traders interest is concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum today.
RSI remains in the moderate territory, and there is plenty of room to gain additional upside momentum in case the right catalysts emerge.

A successful test of the resistance at $48,000 will open the way to the test of the next resistance level at $50,000. In case Bitcoin gets above the key resistance at $50,000, it will attract more speculative traders and head towards the next resistance level which is located at $51,500.

A move above the resistance at $51,500 will open the way to the test of the resistance at $53,000. If Bitcoin manages to settle above the resistance at $53,000, it will move towards the next resistance level at $55,000.

On the support side, Bitcoin needs to get back below $48,000 to have a chance to develop downside momentum in the near term. The next support level for Bitcoin is located at the 20 EMA at $47,300.

If Bitcoin declines below the 20 EMA, it will head towards the support at $46,000. A successful test of this support level will lead to a test of the support at the 50 EMA at $45,500. If Bitcoin declines below the 50 EMA, it will continue its downside move and head towards the support level at $44,000."

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies slumped Monday as assets of all shapes and sizes were caught up in a wave of selling brought on by contagion fears from the mounting problems at embattled property giant China Evergrande Group.

Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, dropped 6.63% to $44,979. It dropped to as low as $44,523 over the past 24 hours. Despite Monday’s slump, Bitcoin has risen more than 55% so far in 2021.

A $150 Billion Wipeout Turns Swiss Stocks Into Month’s Losers

A $150 billion rout has turned Switzerland’s equity market into one of the world’s worst performers this month. 

The Swiss Market Index is down 6.3% in September, poised for its worst pandemic-era showing and the biggest decline among Europe’s main equity gauges, as mounting risks from a surge in bond yields and China Evergrande Group’s woes drive investors away from the country’s highly valued stocks.

The S&P 500 has rallied a bit during the course of the trading session on Tuesday as we continue to see a lot of volatility in the market. Quite frankly, you need to keep one eye on the 10 year yield, and another on the latest noise coming out of China. Chinese markets have been somewhat insulated due to the fact that there is a bank holiday going on, but at the same time there are a lot of concerns when it comes to the Evergrande implosion, and the fact that there are more signs of contagion.
The market breaking down below the lows of the last couple of days certainly would open up a move down to 4200, and it should be noted that the 200 day EMA is hanging about in the 4130 level and looking to get higher. That being the case, I think that will be your short-term “floor the market” if we get any type of support. I would be a buyer in that general vicinity as it could open up a bigger move. The S&P 500 of course has been moving based upon liquidity over the last 13 years and I just do not see that changing anytime soon.

To the upside, if we break above the 50 day EMA, then the market should go looking towards the 4500 level. The level of course is an area that would attract a lot of attention, and clearing that level then it allows the market to go looking towards the 4550 level."

EUR/USD declined below 1.1560 and is testing the next support level at 1.1540.

Euro Moved Closer To Yearly Lows
EUR/USD is currently trying to settle below the support at 1.1540 while the U.S. dollar is gaining ground against a broad basket of currencies.
The U.S. Dollar Index is currently trying to settle above 94.30. In case this attempt is successul, it will continue to move towards yearly highs at 94.50 which will be bearish for EUR/USD.

The main event of the day for foreign exchange market traders is the release of U.S. Non Farm Payrolls report which is expected to show that U.S. economy added 500,000 jobs in September. U.S. Unemployment Rate is projected to decrease from 5.1% in August to 5.2% in September.

Traders will also continue to monitor the developments in U.S. government bond markets. The yield of 10-year Treasuries is currently trying to settle above 1.60%. In case this attempt is successful, it will gain additional upside momentum and move towards the resistance level at 1.63% which will be bullish for the American currency.

Technical Analysis
EUR/USD managed to settle below the support at 1.1560 and is trying to get below the next support level which is located at 1.1540. RSI is in the oversold territory, but there is enough room to gain additional downside momentum in case the right catalysts emerge.

If EUR/USD declines below the support at 1.1540, it will move towards the next support level at 1.1510. A successful test of the support at 1.1510 will push EUR/USD towards the support at 1.1470. In case EUR/USD manages to settle below 1.1470, it will head towards the next support level which is located at 1.1450.

On the upside, the previous support at 1.1560 will serve as the first resistance level for EUR/USD. In case EUR/USD manages to get back above this level, it will head towards the next resistance at 1.1580. A successful test of the resistance level at 1.1580 will open the way to the test of the next resistance at 1.1610."

With APIZ, we intend to tokenize an actual bee. One bee would equate to one APIZ coin.

The cryptocurrency will go hand in hand with our existing beekeeping business, which means that the coin will not be affected by any crypto fluctuations and guarantee the safety of one’s investments.

In our experience, beekeeping has the potential to become incredibly profitable. Today, the approximate cost of a single bee on the market equates to $0.01. The profit it brings sums up to $0.017. We managed to achieve an even greater results - $0.025 per bee in annual revenue. With APIZ, we will reach $0.15 in annual revenue per bee in just 10 years.

Hence, 70% of all investments will be allocated to our offline business development, which will only boost the cost of the APIZ coins in the long run. The other 30% will be used to promote our crypto business.

Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize beekeeping as we know it and give all potential crypto investors the peace of mind they deserve.

APIZ is setting new standards of tokenization that will change the crypto world as we know it!

The Federal Reserve is seen delivering a third straight 75-basis point interest rate hike next week after a government report showed that consumer prices did not ease as expected in August, meaning more work ahead for the central bank as it fights decades-high inflation.

Futures contracts tied to the Fed’s policy rate fell after the Labor Department said the consumer price index climbed 0.1% last month from July, and gained 8.3% from a year earlier. Economists had expected a small monthly decline.

👉Policymakers reiterated the stance to keep rates higher for longer and remain committed to tightening policy further if progress in controlling inflation falters.

👉The current market pricing, however, indicates a greater than 50% chance that the US central bank will start cutting interest rates by May 2024.

That's because Mr. Rinsch had another kind of entertainment in mind.
