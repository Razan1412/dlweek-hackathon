Q: What should we know about this virus and how fast is it spreading?
It's capable of spreading from human to human and seems more infectious than SARS and diseases like flu. In most cases, it causes fairly mild disease. The older you are, the higher the probability of becoming more seriously unwell, although the fatality rate seems relatively low.

Q: Are face masks effective?
Face masks are only one barrier. A more prudent approach to avoiding infections is simple: wash you hands thoroughly with soap and water!

Q: Is there a cure?
A: There is no cure and there are no proven therapies to combat the infection. But at least one hospital has begun a clinical trial assessing promising drug therapies.
